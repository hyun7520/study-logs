ls: list
list the current contents
cd: change directory
~ : at home directory

cd /users/somewhere : absolute first slash means root directory
cd / : go to root
cd ~ : to home
cd ../../pets : relative
mkdir : make directory
mdfir dir dir : make multiple directory
mkdir ../dir : make directory on parent
mkdir dir/newdir

man ls: return manual of ls, enter q to quit
ls -l : show more information
ls -a : show hidden files
ls -la : do both

madir -v dir dir dir : verbose show what happened

touch: make files not really for making files
- change modification and access times of files, if dile does not exist create with default permission
touch text.txt file file
man touch
touch on existing file will change it's access, modification time

rm file: remove file -> no trash can just remove completely
rm is for files, use rmdir for directory but only for empty ones
flag -rf: recursive, force
rm -rf: recursive for nested folders keep removing, force is without asking
